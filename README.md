# basicCar

As I practice python, I am uploading this very basic program to mark the start of my individual python journey. 

What I have here is a very basic program, assumed to be running a car, that can "start" or "stop" the car. It will also be able to detect and inform the user if the car is being started after already having started, or will inform user if the car is being stopped after it has already stopped.
